# portfolio-overview

Welcome! I'm Mokshith Talari, a business & data analyst specializing in SQL, Python, and business intelligence (Power BI/Tableau) with a focus on risk/compliance analytics. This portfolio showcases selected projects that mirror real‑world impacts—such as reducing churn by 18% and saving ~$120 K/year through automation and analytics.

## Projects
- **[etl-bi-pipeline](https://github.com/MokshithTalari/etl-bi-pipeline)** – A lightweight ETL that moves CSV data into a SQLite warehouse and visualizes revenue trends. Includes tests and a GitHub Actions workflow.
- **[risk-model-validation](https://github.com/MokshithTalari/risk-model-validation)** – Implements population stability (PSI), KS statistics, and threshold analysis to validate scoring models using synthetic data and notebooks.
- **[automation-kpi](https://github.com/MokshithTalari/automation-kpi)** – Parses raw application logs into key performance indicators (requests, errors, error rate, peak RPM) with a CLI and tests.

## Highlights
- **SQL & Python automation** – Built pipelines that clean, transform, and load data automatically, saving manual hours.
- **BI dashboards** – Produced clear, actionable revenue and segmentation dashboards ready for Power BI/Tableau.
- **Stakeholder communication** – Wrote concise READMEs explaining each project’s problem, approach, and results to non‑technical audiences.
- **Risk & compliance analytics** – Applied statistical metrics (PSI/KS) to ensure models remain stable and fair across populations.
- **Outcome‑driven impact** – Demonstrated projects that achieve meaningful results (e.g., 18% churn reduction and ~$120 K/year savings).
